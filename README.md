# sorting-algo-visualiser
this project shows different sorting algorithms.


this project contains sorting alogorithms like: bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, merge sort, quick sort and heap sort.

there are different colours used in this project:
-> green: shows the sorted part of the array
-> darkblue: part of the array which is unsorted
-> orange: color used for comparing two array elements
-> red: shows the minimum or the maximum element (depending on the condition of the array)
-> black: used for two algorithms: merge sort and quick sort:
          for merge sort: it indicates the mid element of the array passed
          for quick sort: it indicates the pivot element of the array;
